# Abundance Matching
This script  
(1) calculates the number-density-to-mass curve for galaxies using a double Schechter function for the galaxy stellar mass curve, as fitted by Baldry, I. K. et al. (2011),  
(2) bins and calculates the number densities of dark matter halo masses from the Bolshoi simulation, and  
(3) matches the abundances of dark matter halos and galaxies of certain masses.
